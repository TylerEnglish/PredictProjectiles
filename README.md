# Predict Projectiles

## About the Project

The "Predict Projectiles" project explores the application of various machine learning techniques, including reinforcement learning and Markov models, to develop a game where NPCs learn to dodge and counteract projectiles. This project not only emphasizes the practical implementation of complex algorithms in a dynamic environment but also enhances our understanding of AI's potential in interactive simulations.

## Games

Explore the different games developed as part of this project. Each game variant introduces unique challenges and learning scenarios for the AI models:

- [Falling Object Game](/docs/games/falling_object_section.md): Basic game setup involving objects falling from the sky which the player must avoid.
- [Player Game](/docs/games/PlayerGame.md): Introduces a player-controlled character navigating through hazards.
- [Player Game DQN](/docs/games/PlayerGameDQN.md): Integrates a Deep Q-Network to enhance the player's dodging tactics.
- [Player Game MC](/docs/games/PlayerGameMC.md): Utilizes a Markov Chain for predicting object trajectories.
- [Player Game MCMC](/docs/games/PlayerGameMCMC.md): Combines Markov Chain Monte Carlo methods with reinforcement learning for optimized prediction and gameplay.

## Models

Delve into the models used in this project, each designed to test different aspects of AI learning:
