# Setup Instructions

## Getting Started

This setup guide assumes you have a basic understanding of Python and working knowledge of virtual environments. Follow the steps below to set up your environment to run the Python game using PyGame.

### Prerequisites

- **Python**: Ensure you have Python 3.11.8 installed. You can download it from [python.org](https://www.python.org/downloads/).

### Installation Steps

Install all required packages using the 'pip' command:

```
pip install -r docs/imports.txt
```
